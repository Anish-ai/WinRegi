# AI-Powered Windows Settings Explorer (WinRegi)

## 🚀 Project Overview

WinRegi is an **AI-powered Windows Registry and Settings Manager** built using **PyQt** and **Python**, designed to help users **explore and modify Windows settings effortlessly**. With an AI-integrated search feature, users can find settings based on natural language queries instead of exact keywords.

### 🎯 Why This Project?

Finding the right Windows settings can be frustrating due to:  
✅ A vast number of system settings  
✅ Different categories and locations of settings  
✅ Need to remember exact technical terms

**Solution:** A **smart, AI-powered search assistant** that allows users to type what they want in simple words and **instantly get relevant settings**!

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### 🔹 Backend
- **Python** (Main logic, AI processing, Windows API interaction)
- **PyQt** (GUI framework for desktop app development)
- **Windows API & Registry Access** (For settings modification)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** (For AI-powered search)
- **SQLite** (For storing thousands of pre-defined settings in a structured format)
- **Watchdog** (For hot reloading in development mode)

### 🔹 Frontend (UI)
- **PyQt Designer** (For visually designing UI)
- **Custom Widgets** (For a modern look and feel)
- **Modern glassmorphism UI** with light/dark themes
- **Dedicated UI for Every Setting** (Ensuring easy navigation and interaction)

---
